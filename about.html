				<h4>To make life easier for researchers in Oxford by providing better tools and more opportunities for collaboration.</h4>
				
				
				<p>Wet Lab research takes place across least 15 departments and research centres in Oxford. This spans a huge volume of cutting-edge research and creates many opportunities for us to collaborate.</p>
				<p>However, the complexity of our institution and the interdisciplinary nature of our work can make it challenging to find the right people to work with. It can also be difficult to identify the best way to share knowledge, expertise and data.</p>
				<p>By speeding up and improving how people in different disciplines share data, ChemBio Hub tools are helping in a variety of areas. These include - defining the right biological models to test novel compounds, chemical optimisation of screening hits, finding equipment to run a new assay, and numerous others. <strong>Make much more of this – big splash about how the various projects are being used – base on the case studies (which aren’t the same as the examples above by the looks of them) – EXAMPLES OF WHAT WEVE ACHIEVED</strong></p>
				<p>The ChemBio Hub vision is to provide the tools that will make it easier for Oxford University scientists to connect with colleagues to improve their research, to satisfy funders that the data they have paid for is being managed according to their policies, and to make new alliances with pharma and biotech partners. </p>
				<p>We worked closely with researchers throughout the project to make sure we developed simple, useful tools for scientists. Current functionality includes chemical registration with ChemiReg, and managing laboratory collections (such as plasmids and antibodies) with InventoryReg.</p>
				<p>This allowed us to ensure that the ChemBio Hub is useful and relevant to researchers from a wide range of scientific backgrounds.</p>

				<h2 class="subheading">
		    		Impact
				</h2>
				<p>Using our tools, it is simple for researchers to capture their research data and publicise it to colleagues within the University and beyond. They are able to find out if others have the things they need or who has experience with using something before. This reduces wasted effort, encourages collaboration and supports better, more efficient research.</p>
				<p>Researchers are able to keep track of everything they own and know where it is kept and who is responsible for it. They can also be confident that their data is secure. Data can only be shared by the owner's permission.</p>
				<p>Public funders often require that all of the data coming out of the projects they fund must be made publicly available. It can be a painful exercise for researchers to collate all of their paper and electronic records into a format that satisfies the conditions set by funders. By having a single data repository, designed to manage data in standard ways, we make it easy for researchers to share their data and so satisfy those conditions. This saves researchers’ time and improves quality – so increasing the chance of further funding in fruitful areas of research.</p>
				<p>The ChemBio Hub environment makes it much easier for partners and potential collaborators in biotech and pharmaceutical companies to find and integrate research data. They can then connect with the right people and create mutually beneficial relationships. </p>
				<p>Ultimately the effect of all of these activities is to increase research productivity by increasing efficiency and collaboration whilst reducing unnecessary costs.</p>

		    		Funding was provided as follows:
				</h2>
				
				<h2 class="subheading"> Higher Education Funding Council</h2>
				
								

				<p>
				<img src="/assets/img/funders/hefce.png" alt="Higher Education Funding Council" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>	The <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/kes/heif/" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</a> have contributed £100,000 from the Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF).  This was specifically in support of knowledge exchange activities between the University and the wider world, aimed at providing economic and social benefit to the UK. This contribution funded the appointment of a Knowledge Exchange Coordinator with the role of championing the use of the ChemBio Hub platform.
				</p>
				<p>
				The <a href="mailto:michael.ohagan@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk">KE Coordinator</a> acted as a central coordinator for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology knowledge within the University, bringing together groups from various Divisions and Departments to increase collaboration and reduce duplication of effort. Their role included maximising the transfer of knowledge within the University as well as with external organisations. This increased the impact of the science generated and provided new opportunities to enhance the University's role in drug discovery internationally.
				</p>

				
				<h2 class="subheading">ISSF</h2>
				
					       		

				<p>
				<img src="/assets/img/funders/welcome.png" alt="The Wellcome Trust" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>
				The ISSF commissioned a series of audits of strategic equipment within the University, led by leading researchers.  These included <a href="http://www.issf.ox.ac.uk/_asset/file/small-molecule-audit.pdf" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>one focused on small molecules in biomedical research</a>, headed by Dr Paul Brennan and published in April 2013.  One key finding of that audit was that “It is currently very difficult for one research group within the University to know if another group has expertise in a certain assay or screening technique. There is also no mechanism for one group to know if another group has compounds of interest for either target discovery or lead discovery.”  Following this finding, the ISSF then provided a total of £225,000 of funding to support development of a University-wide Chemical Biology data and reagent sharing platform, which subsequently became known as ChemBio Hub.

					<h2 class="subheading"> Nuffield Department of Medicine</h2>
				
					        	

				<p><img src="/assets/img/funders/ndm.png" alt="Nuffield Dept of Medicine" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>
				The <a href="http://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/home" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>Nuffield Department of Medicine</a> provided £50,000 of funding in support of the project.
				</p>	
				
				<h2 class="subheading"> John Fell Fund</h2>
				
				 

				<p><img src="/assets/img/funders/johnfell.png" alt="The John Fell Fund" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>
				The <a href="http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/pras/jff/about/" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);' >John Fell Fund</a> provided £125,000 of matching funding to support the ChemBio Hub project. Data resulting from University screening programmes is currently shared ad-hoc. One common way is by emailing various spreadsheets around. The problem with this approach is that it depends on informal knowledge of work in various departments. The John Fell funding addressed the critical need to record and share data by providing a central platform for chemical biology data.
